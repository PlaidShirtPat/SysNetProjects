Communication between Peers and server:
  - peers send a connection message: "sup?"
  - server records ipaddress and port# in a list
  - server then sends a message in the following format: "<prevPeerIP>;<prevPeerPort>,<nextPeerIP>;<nextPeerPort>,<peerID>"
      note: peerID is based on the order in which peers contact the server.

Communication between peers:
  Starting communication:
    - The peer with peerID 0 starts the token ring.
    - The token starts as a simple string: "tok:"
  Exiting the ring:
    - The peer appends their prevPeer and nextPeer information to the token and passes it to their nextPeer
    - The next peer then processes this information and updates it's peer information.
    - This protocol will "collapse" drop notifications from neighboring peers, 
      reducing the information to a single drop notification to the two remaining neighbors that need to update
