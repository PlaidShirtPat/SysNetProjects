Battle plan:

1. finish the priority queue so we can finish implimenting Dijkstra's

2. get dijkstra's alrogithm working on tables

3. Test Dijkstra's with multiple updates w/o network communication

4. Get the network communication working so that servers can read their files and then talk to eachother
	 //Server gets it's IP/Port from the network graph file.

5. Once we have static graphs working, get the link state packets working. 
	- All we have to do is send those into the graph update algorithm as a new path cost list.





Network update packet:

"<nodeID>;<nodeID>,<cost>;<nodeID>,<cost>....."
a cost of  INT_MAX will represent infinite distances

Dijkstra's algorithm:
Table


startup process:

load node info from the file. Then create socket based off of port/ip from the socket info
